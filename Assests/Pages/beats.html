        <h3>Product Description:</h3>

    <p>
        The Beats Fit Pro is just as easy to use with an Android device as it is with an iPhone. It seems Apple-owned Beats is trying to appeal to a wider market, and it works. <br>
         Fit Pro fits like a pro with the ear tip fit test and multiple ear tips. Sound quality is sure to please most athletes, but the Fit Pro is just at home in the office as it is in the gym. 
        <br>The main factor holding the Beats Fit Pro back from gold is the price.
